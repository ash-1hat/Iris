  "notes": "CRITICAL ISSUE: Initial waiting period NOT met - Policy started 01/11/2024, admission 12/11/2024 = only 11 days elapsed, required 30 days. However, documentation is complete and medical emergency is well-justified (perforation with peritonitis requiring immediate surgery). Higher cost (Rs.1,25,000 vs typical Rs.85,000) is justified by complications (perforation, abscess, peritonitis, extended 6-day stay with 2 ICU days). Room rent Rs.24,000/6 days = Rs.4,000/day which is UNDER Rs.5,000/day limit for SI 5L. Agent 2 should FAIL with CRITICAL violation for waiting period. Other agents should PASS given excellent documentation and justified emergency. NOTE: Some policies waive waiting period for accidents/emergencies - need to check Bajaj policy terms."
