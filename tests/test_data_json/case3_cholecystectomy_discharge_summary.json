Calot's triangle dissected - cystic duct and artery identified and clipped. During dissection, cystic duct appeared dilated. Intraoperative cholangiogram performed via cystic duct cannulation which revealed filling defect in common bile duct (CBD) suggestive of CBD stone (12mm diameter, located in mid-CBD). Decision made to proceed with laparoscopic CBDE. CBD exposed and longitudinal choledochotomy performed (15mm incision). Stone extracted using Dormia basket under fluoroscopic guidance. CBD flushed with saline - completion cholangiogram showed clear bile duct, free flow into duodenum, no residual stones. 14Fr T-tube inserted into CBD and secured. Choledochotomy closed around T-tube with 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures. Cholecystectomy completed - gallbladder dissected from liver bed, extracted via umbilical port in specimen bag. Hemostasis achieved. 16Fr drain placed in Morrison's pouch. Ports closed in layers.",

Liver function tests ordered - showed mild elevation (Total Bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL, SGOT 88 U/L, SGPT 102 U/L) - expected post-CBDE, trend improving.",
    "day2": "Post-op day 2 (12/10): T-tube output: 220ml bile. Drain output minimal (20ml). Abdominal drain removed as output <30ml and serous. Started on soft diet, tolerating well. Walking independently. Pain well controlled with oral analgesics. LFT improving (Bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL).",

Patient and family trained on T-tube home care.",

  "complications": "Intraoperative finding of common bile duct stone requiring unplanned additional procedure (laparoscopic CBDE with T-tube insertion). This was NOT a post-operative complication but an unanticipated pathological finding discovered during surgery. The CBD stone was not visualized on pre-operative USG (CBD diameter was 5mm on USG, stone was 12mm - likely mobile stone that moved into CBD between USG and surgery). Intraoperative cholangiogram confirmed the finding and guided successful laparoscopic extraction. No bile leak, no post-operative bleeding, no wound infection.",
