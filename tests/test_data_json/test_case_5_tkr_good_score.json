Minor gaps: Missing specific PT trial duration details, no detailed pain scoring timeline, could provide more specific functional assessment metrics. Cost is median range for TKR (Rs.2,75,000). Room rent Rs.30,000/5 days = Rs.6,000/day which is UNDER Rs.10,000/day limit for SI 10L. Should score 75-80 with minor WARNING from Agent 3 for documentation gaps."
